I am an interdisciplinary creative who finds satisfaction in building objects and crafting joyful experiences. By building provocative scenarios and artifacts that challenge our assumptions about the future, I hope to contribute to a more harmonious human-computer interaction. I'm building a website right now. [coreyhhowell.com](https://www.coreyhhowell.com/)
